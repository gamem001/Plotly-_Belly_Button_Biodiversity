# Plotly_Belly_Button_Biodiversity

Using the dataset �Belly Button Biodiversity�, an interactive dashboard was created with user interaction in mind. The dataset catalogs microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
Data was read in using d3 in order to build a dropdown menu and plot the top ten OTU�s on both a bar graph and a bubble chart.
