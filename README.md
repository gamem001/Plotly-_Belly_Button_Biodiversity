# Plotly_Belly_Button_Biodiversity

Using the dataset “Belly Button Biodiversity”, I will create an interactive dashboard. The dataset catalogs microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
I will read in the data using d3 in order to build a dropdown menu and plot the top ten OTU’s on both a bar graph and a bubble chart.
